PyTalker-V01 ( Python Program To Share Secured Important Messages Privately.)



[] Why Should I Use It ? 

 Because it's fast, Private and Secure.

 It's Secure because it uses cryptography technique to encrypt and decrypt messages between client and server ie. your messages will be completely
 Hidden from the eyes of hackers.

 In Easy Terms, If anyone tries to perform sniffing or MITM attack they will not get your messages , they will get encrypted hashes.


[] Pre-requisite to run Chat-Bot Program :

 1.) Python 3
 2.) Cryptography Module (pip install cryptography)
 3.) Designed To Work On Windows ( not tested on other platforms so it may raise errors. )

What is this ?

 Basically it's a python program which allows 2 people to chat ie. exchange messages.



[] How Stable This Is ?

As currently, it is in development phase it's full of bugs. 
However, As far as the main purpose of this program is concern it's working fine currently.

I will really appreciate if you have anything to suggest or something to correct .

[] Known Bugs :

 1.) Facing Problems to Quit Program Once Started Without Forcing It. (Problem Due To Threading)
 2.) Client Take Time To Connect With Server, However Server Connects Instantly.


[] How To Use This Program ?

 The Person Having Server Needs To Forward Port And Client Only Needs To Connect With Server, So it's Preferable To Keep Server With
 You And Give Client To Your Friend.

 Both Server And Client Requires A Common Key To Work , This Key Is Required Because Of Symmetric Encryption ie. That Key Will Be Required To
 Lock And Unlock Messages Between Client And Server.

 So, You Can First Generate The Key And Send The Key To Your Friend Or Your Friend Being A Client Can Also Generate Key And Send It To You.

[] How Key Is Generate ?

 It Will Be Generated Automatically When You Run Server / Client For First Time, However You Need To Undestand That Both Client And Server Needs 
 A Same Key So Only Key Of One Should Be Used.

I'll Upload A Youtube Video Shortly To Demonstrate The Usage.
